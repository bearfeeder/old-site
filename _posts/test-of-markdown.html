<h1>Chapter 1 Introduction</h1>

<p>This document describes the <a href="http://visi.io">Visi</a> language. Visi is
an open source language that blends concepts from spreadsheets,
scripting languages, functional languages such as Haskell and OCaml,
and other systems. The goal of Visi is to be accessible for Excel
power users, yet be “correct” such that runnable code should be
substantially bug-free. Visi forms the basis for the
<a href="http://Visi.Pro">Visi.Pro</a> platform that allows programming on iPads
and those programs can run on iPads, iPhones, as well as in the cloud.</p>

<p>Features of Visi include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Guaranteed serializability of user-created data structures (like
Erlang) such that data structures can seamlessly migrate across
address spaces.</li>
<li>Visually pleasing syntax that makes simple programs as well as very
complex programs easy to understand. The syntax is whitespace-oriented
and eschews curly-braces, line ending markers, etc.</li>
<li>Persistent (immutable) data structures except for certain data
structures that do not escape the boundaries of library calls
(everything that “end users” see is immutable).</li>
<li>Clear demarcations of side effects (sources [input]/sinks [output]
and references) such that the order and locus of computations is
invisible to the programmer until a commit operation to a sink or
reference occurs.</li>
<li>A type system that is simultaneously powerful and invisible. End
users cannot write type annotations. Library authors can construct
very complex type expressions that are evaluated at compile time to
insure code correctness. Programs will not be allowed to run unless
they pass the type checker. Note that getting error messages “right”
will be a serious challenge for Visi.</li>
<li>Visi will be self-hosted with a built-in IDE like Smalltalk. The
initial IDE will be Mac OS X based.</li>
<li>Visi will support incremental development such that changes can be
made to “running” programs like changes can be made to a spreadsheet
and the changes are immediately reflected. However, Visi programs will
be compiled to various more efficient representations including
converting Visi lambda calculus representations to GHC intermediate
representations such that Visi programs can be compiled to any
supported GHC back-ends including LLVM, native code, and potentially
JavaScript. Visi can also be run interpreted on iOS devices.</li>
<li>Visi, like spreadsheets, performs computations when external state
changes and updates outputs. This makes Visi ideal for writing systems
that rely on external data feeds and Visi can trigger events when new
data from data feeds is received.</li>
</ul>


<p>This document is an evolving description of the Visi language as well
as a discussion/justification for the design decisions.</p>

<h1>Chapter 2 Motivation</h1>

<p>Do we need yet another computer language? Is there currently a
“Cambrian explosion” of computer languages and why Visi?</p>

<p>Well, yes. Most computer languages, especially the ones that are
cropping up these days, seem to re-visit ideas of past computer
languages. They make minor syntactic changes or in other ways make
small alterations to the kind of basic concepts that have been around
computing for years.</p>

<p>There are notable exceptions. Clojure embraced Lisp syntax, but
fundamentally changes <a href="http://www.artima.com/articles/hickey_on_time.html">mutable state into an issue of
time</a>.
<a href="http://scala-lang.org">Scala</a> made material advances in computer
languages by blending a rich mostly consistent type system with object
oriented programming. Most other languages that have been introduced
this millennium are minor variants on Smalltalk or C++ or Java.</p>

<p>Visi takes a different approach. Visi approaches the problem of
describing how a computer should respond to input in a similar manner
to spreadsheets. Visi approaches computing from the perspective of a
dependency graph when outputs change as inputs change and only outputs
that depend on a particular input are recomputed when a particular
input changes. The dependency graph is intuitive to anyone who has
ever put together an Excel spreadsheet (or a 1-2-3 spreadsheet or even
a VisiCalc spreadsheet.)</p>

<p>More broadly, my motivation for Visi is to create a language that
fundamentally changes the way people program computers such that Visi
is a language oriented to humans rather than a veneer on top of
computing machinery. Visi is not a tool for writing compilers
(although it will be mostly self-hosting). But, instead, Visi is a
tool for normal people to model, to describe relationships such that a
network of computers can perform calculations based on external input
and generate predictable, correct output. My motivation for Visi is to
change the landscape of computer languages the way that VisiCalc
changed the language and computing landscape in 1979.</p>

<h1>Chapter 3 Language Samples</h1>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at some Visi language samples.</p>

<p>First, “Hello, World!”:</p>

<p><code>
"Greeting" = "Hello, World!"
</code></p>

<p>The lefthand side of the equation has quotes around it, meaning that
it&rsquo;s a “Sink”. A Sink is output that can be wired up to a user
interface or some other external output.</p>

<p>Next, let&rsquo;s take a number from a “Source” (an input), add 1 to the
number and send it to a “Sink” called “Plus One”:</p>

<p><code>
?number
"Plus One" = number + 1
</code></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to define functions:</p>

<p><code>
addOne n = n + 1 // a function that adds 1 to the input
?number
"Plus One" = addOne number
</code></p>

<p>And functions can be recursive:</p>

<p><code>
fact n = if n == 0 then 1 else n * fact n - 1
res = fact 10 // 3628800
</code></p>

<p>Syntactically, variables (and local functions) need only be offset by
spaces from the upper level declaration:</p>

<p><code>
f n = // add 33 to the input
 v = 33 // the variable v is set to 33
 n + v // return the result because it's the last line of the function
</code></p>

<p>In action:</p>

<p><code>
f n =
 v = 33
 n + v
res = f 3 // res == 36
</code></p>

<p>Functions can be local as well:</p>

<p><code>
f n = // calculate the factorial of the input
 fact n = if n == 0 then 1 else n * fact(n - 1)
 fact n
</code></p>

<p>Inner functions can shadow outer function. The function in the nearest
scope, wins. Also partially applied functions can be passed as
parameters:</p>

<p>```
fact n = n &amp; &ldquo;hello&rdquo; /<em> proper scoping: fact is not the inner fact </em>/
f n = /<em> Test partially applied functions </em>/
 // a local fact function that is visible within this function only
 fact n = if n == 0 then 1 else n * fact(n &ndash; 1)
 app n fact // apply the fact function to the input</p>

<p>/<em> Apply the function f to the value </em>/
app v f = f v</p>

<p>res = f 8 // 40320.0
```</p>

<p>Partially applied functions close over local scope:</p>

<p>```
f b = /<em> test that the function closes over local scope </em>/
 timesb n m = n * b * m
 timesb /* partially apply the function which closes over</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>the scope of the 'b' parameter */</pre></div>
</div>


<p>app v f = f v</p>

<p>q = f 8 // return a partially applied function</p>

<p>z = f 10 // return another partially applied function</p>

<p>res = (app 9 (app 8 q)) &ndash; ((z 8 9) + (z 1 1)) // -154
```</p>

<p>Rolling input, functions and output together:</p>

<p>```
/<em> Input </em>/
?taxRate // source the tax rate
?taxable
?nonTaxable</p>

<p>/<em> Computations </em>/
total = subtotal + tax
tax = taxable * taxRate
subtotal = taxable + nonTaxable</p>

<p>/<em> Output </em>/
&ldquo;Total&rdquo; = total // sink the total
&ldquo;Tax&rdquo; = tax // sink the tax
```</p>

<p>And the type checker insures you don&rsquo;t mix types:</p>

<p><code>
f = 3
d = f &amp; "hi" // fails... can't mix a number with a String
</code></p>

<p>The typer supports the identity function and type variables:</p>

<p><code>
q n = n
f n = if true then n else (q n) // both q and f are generic function
</code></p>

<p>Generic functions, even at multiple levels of recursion can be correctly typed:</p>

<p><code>
a n = b n
b n = c n
c n = a n // a, b, and c are all generic functions
</code></p>

<p>Functions can be mutually recursive without any hints to the type
checker (like OCaml&rsquo;s let rec):</p>

<p>```
isOdd n = if n == 1 then true else not (isEven (n &ndash; 1))
isEven n = if n == 0 then true else not (isOdd (n &ndash; 1))</p>

<p>// define the not function
not n = if n then false else true</p>

<p>// the result is true (9 is odd)
res = isOdd 9
```</p>

<p>More language samples as Visi evolves.</p>

<h1>Chapter 4 The Visi Language</h1>

<p>Visi is a literate language.  That means that Visi models are Markdown
documentation that contain the model inside the text.  This is because
Visi models tell a story and the descriptive part of the story is more
important than the instructions to the computer.  For example:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>This is a *Visi* model.  This text tells the story of the model.

Add one to parameter:
```
addOne n = n + 1 // this is the logic in the model
```

I'm telling more of a story… and you can learn more about the
[Visi language](https://github.com/visi-lang/visi/wiki/language).</pre></div>
</div>


<p>If the Visi parser detects two or more sets of triple back-ticks in
the document, it parses only the contents of the triple back-ticks.
In this way, Visi models also display correctly as <a href="http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/">Github Flavored
Markdown</a>.</p>

<p>The rest of this chapter will be examples of the Visi language models
and will not discuss
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a>.</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<p>All expressions and functions in Visi are lazily evaluated (except
that certain built in
functions may be strictly evaluated to improve performance).
Expressions in a model are evaluated on demand.  The demand comes from
a source (input) changing and recomputing all sinks (outputs) depend
on that source.  The Visi runtime makes no guarantee about the
order of evaluation or even the location of evaluation.  Visi models,
like Excel models,</p>

<h2>Language Pieces</h2>

<h3>A zero parameter function:</h3>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>myFunc = 33</pre></div>
</div>


<h3>A one parameter function:</h3>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>oneParam n = n + 1</pre></div>
</div>


<h3>if/then/else</h3>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>zeroOrMore n = if n &gt; 0 then n else 0</pre></div>
</div>


<h3>Calling a function</h3>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>myFunc n = n + 1
callFunc n = myFunc n
res = callFunc 5 // res == 6</pre></div>
</div>


<h3>Partially Applying a Function</h3>

<p>A function can be partially applied:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>mult a b = a * b
times8 = mult 8
res = times8 2 // res == 16</pre></div>
</div>


<p>As can an operator:</p>

<p>```
plus1 = (1 +)
res = plus1 5 // res == 6</p>

<p>plus = (+)
res = plus 1 2 // res == 3</p>

<p>```</p>

<h3>Local functions (zero and more parameters)</h3>

<p>Local functions can take zero or more parameters and close over local
scope.  For example:</p>

<p><code>
// create a partially applied function that multiplies by the param
multBy param =
   times a b = a * b
   toReturn = times param // partially apply the local times function
   toReturn
</code></p>

<p>Both <code>times</code> and <code>toReturn</code> are functions local to the <code>multBy</code> scope.
 <code>toReturn</code> closes over local scope (the <code>param</code> parameter)</p>

<h3>Whitespace is significant</h3>

<p>Visi does not have a line ending character, but leading whitespace is
significant.</p>

<p>A line that is indented deeper than the line above it is a logical continuation
of the line above.  The simplest example is:</p>

<p><code>
myFunc n =
  n + 1
</code>
Or:</p>

<p>```
myFunc n =
  if n > 0 then n</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>else n * -1</pre></div>
</div>


<p>```</p>

<p>Local functions are nested via whitespace:</p>

<p>```
myFunc a b =
  aTimes2 = a * 2
  mySillyFunc n =</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>myInnerFunc b = b + 1 // b is scoped to the param of myInnerFunc
thing = n * 3
myInnerFunc thing // the results of mySillyFunc</pre></div>
</div>


<p>  (mySillyFunc b) + aTimes2 // (b * 3) + 1 + (a * 2)
```</p>

<p>At this point, there is no support for tabs, so whitespace means space
characters (ASCII 32).</p>

<h3>Sources</h3>

<p>Visi processes information that comes from a source or input.  A
source can come from user input, an external
process, or even from the sink (output) of another Visi
model.</p>

<p>a source is defined by placing a <code>?</code> before an identifier:</p>

<p><code>
?number // a source
nextNumber = number + 1 // a function that references the number source
</code></p>

<h3>Sinks</h3>

<p>A <code>sink</code> is the result of applying a model to the value
of sources.</p>

<p>A sink is defined by a quoted identifier on the left hand side of an equation:</p>

<p><code>
"greeting" = "Hello, World!"
</code></p>

<p>Sinks can depend on sources and when a predicate source
changes, all dependent sinks are computed and triggered.  Trigger
causes any external systems associated with the sink to be updated.</p>

<p>```
?number</p>

<p>&ldquo;next&rdquo; = number + 1
```</p>

<h3>Primative Types</h3>

<p>Visi has the following data types built in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Boolean</li>
<li>Integer (8 bit, 16 bit, 32 bit, 64 bit and arbitrary precision)</li>
<li>Double Precision Floating point (single precision floating point?)</li>
<li>Rational numbers (numbers with arbitrary precision Integer as
numerator and denominator)</li>
<li>String (Unicode capable, UTF-8 encodable)</li>
<li>Date with millisecond precision and TimeSpan</li>
<li>Geospatial (long/lat)</li>
<li>Media (image, sound, mpeg &mdash; Yeah, the could be compound data
structures, but I
think it&rsquo;s optimal to have the data structure be native so we can
lazily load the media or stream it)</li>
<li>Array</li>
<li>Byte Array (separate from Array for performance reasons)</li>
</ul>


<p>Additionally, the Visi language has built-in syntax support for Lists,
although List is implemented as a library.  The syntax is
Haskell-like:</p>

<p>```
myAnimals = [&ldquo;Archer&rdquo;, &ldquo;Madeline&rdquo;, &ldquo;Elwood&rdquo;]
ageRange = [1 .. 50]
inifiniteRange = [ 1 .. ]</p>

<p>head a:rest = a
tail a:rest = rest |</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>_ = Nil</pre></div>
</div>


<p>```</p>

<p>Visi also supports tuples (Product types) at the parser level but the
implementation of tuples will be done in libraries:</p>

<p>```
me = (&ldquo;David&rdquo;, 48)
returnValue = (200, True, &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;)</p>

<p>```</p>

<h3>Data Structures</h3>

<p>Visi has data structures that are, in ML parlance, union types.</p>

<p>Constants:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>struct Bool2 = True | False</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Simple data structures:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>struct Dog(String)</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Simple data structures with named properties:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>struct Cat(name: String)</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Union types:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>struct Thing = This(String) |
               That(when: Date)</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Union types with common constructors:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>struct Person(String, age: Int) =
    Kid() |
    Parent(kids: [Person])

daniel = Kid(&quot;Daniel&quot;, 8)
david = Parent(&quot;David&quot;, 48, [daniel])</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Union type with properties:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>struct WritingInstrument =
    property
        size = Millimeter 7
    Pencil(color: String) |
    Pen(inkColor: String)
    // Both Pen and Pencil have a size property

struct Animal =
    Moose(height: Int)
      property
          hasHorns = True
    Fish(freshWater: Bool)
    // Only Moose has the hasHorns property</pre></div>
</div>


<p>All union types are also product types (tuples) where the arity of the tuple
is the number of Type Constructor parameters.  So the following is a
struct definition that also defined a 2 position tuple:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>struct Album(name: String, length: TimeSpan)</pre></div>
</div>


<h3>Pattern Matching</h3>

<p>Type Constructor/Extractor:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>dogsName Dog(name) = name
kidsName Kid(name, _) = name</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Nominal pattern matching (will match any type with a <code>name</code> property):</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>name (name =&gt; theName) = theName // you can pass Cat or Person to</pre></div>
</div>


<p>the name function</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>names (name =&gt; ) = name // shorthand to set the local name variable</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Positional pattern matching (match any tuple with the same arity):</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>first (ret, _) = ret
second (_, ret) = ret</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Positional pattern matching with specific types:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>firstString (str: String, _) = str</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Nominal pattern matching with testing.  The example
below will match any type that has a <code>name</code> property that is equal
to <code>"fred"</code> and has an <code>age</code> property that&rsquo;s an <code>Int</code>.  The return type
is <code>Box Int</code> (<code>Box</code> is similar to <code>Option</code> or <code>Maybe</code>) because the
pattern is non-exhaustive.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>fredsAge (name == &quot;fred&quot;, age: Int =&gt;) = age</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Pattern matching against a type constructor:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>fredsAge2 Person(name == &quot;fred&quot;, age =&gt;) = age // Box Int</pre></div>
</div>


<h3>Object-Oriented Features</h3>

<p>Visi is structurally typed, like OCaml. This means that any type with
a given property or method can be a parameter to a function or
method that accesses the property/method.  Find the age
of any type with an age property/method:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>anyAge n = n.age // polymorphic in the return type of age</pre></div>
</div>


<p>Property/method accessors can also be curried so that you don&rsquo;t
need the thing that the accessor is applied to:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>anyAge2 = #age

anyAgeTest n =
  n.age == #age n</pre></div>
</div>


<p>We can define methods on a type:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>struct Foo(age: Int)
    methods
        old? = self.age &gt; 85
        addToAge n = self.age + n</pre></div>
</div>


<p>We can also define properties on a type:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>struct Bar(age: Int)
    property
        name = &quot;Bar&quot;</pre></div>
</div>


<p>All structs are immutable.  So, to create new instances, we
use updators (Visi may implement
<a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/symmetric-full.pdf">lenses</a>,
but not right now…
also maybe <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/zippers">zippers</a> in the future).</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>kid = Kid &quot;Daniel&quot; 7
birthday = kid.= 8
birthday == Kid &quot;Daniel&quot; 8</pre></div>
</div>


<p>And the updator can be partially applied:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>make8 = #=age 8

birthday == make8 kid</pre></div>
</div>


<p>We can also update via a function:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>nextYear k = k.&gt; (+ 1)
nextYear2 = #&gt;age (+ 1)

birthday == nextYear kid
birthday == nextYear2 kid</pre></div>
</div>
